# Pickled Industries More Parts mod for KSP

Adds a lot of extra parts that I felt was necessary for better exploration, also allowing us to lower the part count of our vessels

The items currently added are:
  - 2x bigger stronger thrusters
  - 2x Stronger Xenon Ion thrusters with a overheating downside
  - 2x Stronger LFO Ion thrusters with more overheating downsides
  - bigger RTG
  - A bigger Solar Panel that actually has a radiator on the rear of it!! (The in game large solar panel was supposed to have a radiator effect on it but was skipped...)
