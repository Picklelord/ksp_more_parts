	description = The recent discovery of a fourth law of physics made it possible for Pickled Industry's engineers to (re-)produce these small Ion-monopropellant hybrid thrusters to be even smaller then the old steadler thrusters. Even though many Kerbal physicists still dispute the validity of this new law, studies show that the thrusters seem to work better then advertised...
